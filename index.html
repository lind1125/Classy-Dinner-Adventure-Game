        <p id="room1">You are leaning casually on the outside wall of the famously exclusive restaurant Chez de LeChuck, a few feet from the <span class="interactive target">front door</span>. <br>Nearby, there is a low-hanging <span class="interactive target">branch</span> of a maple tree covered in autumn leaves. <br>A very <span class="interactive target">well-dressed person</span> is talking excitedly on their cell phone, though you can't quite make out what they're saying. <br>A <span class="interactive target">gruff older person</span> is sitting on a stool near what appears to be a repurposed valet podium, a leaf blower laying across their lap.</p>
        <p id="room2">You are seated at a cozy <span class="interactive target">table</span> in the middle of the restaurant, a hand-written <span class="interactive target">menu</span> laid out before you.<br>A clean-cut <span class="interactive target">server</span> is strutting purposefully throughout the restaurant.<br>Toward the back of the restaurant, you can see the entrance to the <span class="interactive target">kitchen</span> as well as another door that must be the <span class="interactive target">restroom</span>.</p>
        <p id="room3">'The kitchen is bustling with activity. Amidst the chaos and clouds of steam, it's difficult to focus on very much, but you notice right in front of you that there is a cart full fancy looking <span class="interactive target">bottled water</span>.<br>You glance back to make sure no one has taken your <span class="interactive target">table</span>.<br>Looking at all this water kind of makes you want to use the <span class="interactive target">restroom</span>.</p>
